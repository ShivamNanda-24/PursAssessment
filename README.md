# PursAssessment

In this assessment, I developed a Restaurant Screen feature that showcases a restaurant's operational hours. The screen not only displays the business hours but also includes a live status indicator that reflects the current operational state of the restaurant. This project was built using Kotlin's Jetpack Compose, adhering to the MVVM design pattern.

Assumptions:

1.Emphasize the current date and operating hours by displaying them in bold.
2. If hours of a day are  not given, consider the resutatnt closed.
